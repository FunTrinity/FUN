    <h1>A Brief about myself.</h1>
    <hr>
    <h3>My name is Ugochi Nweke</h3>
    <p>Friends and frenemies alike call me <strong>Trinity,Fun</strong>..<br> I am currently enrolled in the <strong>Genesys Upskill Program <em>website development section</em></strong>. I am a newbie at web development, but I aim to master coding with the help of upskill tutors, very soon. I ventured into the world of web development late last year as soon as I finished my final year exams, dabbling around here and there  until my elder brother told me about the Genesys upskill program to register and learn there too.</p>
    <p>Although I must say, web development has not been easy, it's been very challenging, and I am open to challenges. I'm currently a beginner; trying to learn from the scratch, so I'm just patiently waiting for mentors to be assigned to us, so I can get someone to put me through.</p>
    <p>I hope to learn the best just from the very best.</p>
    <p>Big thanks to Genesys Upskill for this opportunity.</p>
